# Tanisha Portcorner 🪄  
My expressive portfolio built with Next.js, Tailwind CSS & Framer Motion

Welcome to my creative corner of the internet —  
a digital space where design meets emotion, and where technology listens before it speaks.

## 👋 About Me  
Hi, I’m **Tanisha Hasan** —  
An AI Product Creator, Frontend Developer, and Digital Storyteller.

I create intelligent and intuitive web experiences that feel deeply human.  
I built [TALKwithAI](https://talkwithai-tanisha.vercel.app) because I believe tech should be kind, thoughtful, and emotionally aware.
